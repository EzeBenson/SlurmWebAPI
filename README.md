# SlurmWebAPI
This is an open source Java based API which allows users to apply deep learning models to images.
It applies the methods to images by submitting jobs to slurm via PSEXEC.
The model being applied to the images for a given job is held in the modelstore.

The current code is an initial implementation of the above and is a work in progress. 
The code base is being expanded so that the API includes more features.
