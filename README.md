This is a Java based API which allows users to apply analysis methods to images.
Jobs are submitted to a server which uses a scalable workload manager to schedule them.
The server is also responsible for executing the analysis methods.

The current code is an initial implementation of the above and is a work in progress. 
The code base is being expanded so that the API includes more features.
